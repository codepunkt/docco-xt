Docco-XT is a fork of Docco that tackles some of the problems Docco is having
with larger codebases.

Therefore, an additional option to specify a base directory was added.
When used, all documented files are displayed with paths relative
to the given directory. This not only allows for documenting of multiple files
having the same name, but also helps getting a better overview over the documented
codebase.

Additionally, filenames can be searched when used in parallel layout:

To search for a filename, press [ESC] or focus the search input manually.
When you type in a filename or parts of it, you can navigate the filtered
results with [↓] and [↑] and view the selected result with [ENTER].
